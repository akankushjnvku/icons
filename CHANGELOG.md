# v0.3.1
## Use separated `create-svg-icon-sprite` package

The https://github.com/transferwise/create-svg-icon-sprite package was separated
to simplify this repository for designers and to allow other people/companies to use the same process.

# v0.2.1
## Fix build and edit demo style

Previously, any file (even `.DS_Store`, f.e.) resulted in an entry in the icons demo.
We now filter to `.svg` files only.

The demo also now has a blue period in the title, which, by the way, is now sentence-case.
